# NodeNotes
NodeNotes - Express and MySQL note taking app

# How it Works
This app can be used to create simple notes that are then stored in a MySQL database. There is also the option to delete notes from the database. <br/>

Currently, any user can see any note that anyone posted, so in the future, there may be a way to authenticate users so they can only see/edit their own notes.
